seLoginUI:
Added moderator validation

seModeratorHomeUI:
public moderatorHomeController (moderator m)
{
    this.m = m;
    modHome = new seModeratorHomeUI();
    modHome.setVisible(true);
    displayModeratorInfo();
}
	
private void reportButtonActionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) {                                             
    this.setVisible(false);
    modGenController modReport = new modGenController(m); //changed
    
} 

Minor change to these two by being able to view comment when the row is clicked:
seViewQuestion
seViewAnswerUI

Also changed the UI for seViewAnswerUI, as I added another textarea because I felt that full answer to the question needs to be shown somewhere.
Will need to change wireframe for seViewAnswerUI.

All other changes affected by removal of noOfVote column

seModGenUI (in controller class);
private moderator retrieveInfo, m;
private seModGenUI modReport;
modGenController(moderator m)
{
    this.m = m;
    modReport = new seModGenUI();
    modReport.setVisible(true);
}
